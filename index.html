<h1>Flowers and Lillies</h1>

 <p>Grass and Brass with white accents,<br> this field is one with many color depths <br> 
   A little blue butterfly flutters along with his friends <br> 
   they stopped and stared as they seemed to lose all their sense</p> Roses, Lavender, Sage and Thyme <br>
  all of them together, you would think it was a crime <br> the little butterflies were in awe of this so they rested on some vine
  <br> all they could ponder on was the beautiful sopecimens and their shine
  <p> The wind blew, and rain drops were felt <br>so the little butterflies had to go as their hearts began to melt 
  <br> this wasn't the end for they had more fields to see <br> they all fluttered away happily as they said bye to the smell of the lily <p/>
  
  <p>The End </p>
